I have been using the `wrap` modifier more and more recently. A very simple yet powerful modifier to help clean up my templates a little bit.

Simply put it wraps a string with a given HTML tag, it also has the nice benefit of returning `null` if there is no data â€“ making standard if statements rather reduntant. See below example for clarification.

```html
<!-- Instead of doing this... -->
{{ if title }}
  <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
{{ /if }}

<!-- You can do this ðŸš€ -->
{{ title | wrap:h1 }}
```

Want to add classes to your element? Sure, no problem â€“ You may add Emmet-style CSS classes to the tag;

```html
{{ title | wrap:h1.fast.furious }}
```

Above example will will give you the following output:

```html
<h1 class="fast furious">My title data</h1>
```

And that's pretty much it, reference; [https://docs.statamic.com/modifiers/wrap](https://docs.statamic.com/modifiers/wrap)
