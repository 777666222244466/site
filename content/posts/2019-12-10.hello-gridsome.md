So I migrated my Laravel site over to using Gridsome in less than an hour, come along as I share my experience on using Gridsome as a first-timer.

## What is Gridsome?

Gridsome is a free and open source Vue.js-powered framework for building websites & apps. Incredibly easy setup yet extremely powerful. 

It has a lot of cool features such as;

- GraphQL data layer
- Static file generation
- Automatic Code Splitting

You can read more about all of its features and how it works in the [documentation.](https://gridsome.org/docs/#why-gridsome) 

If you're into the JAMstack and haven't given Gridsome a go yet, you really â€“ **like really really** should!
