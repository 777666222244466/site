Earlier this year [I wrote a post](/using-laravel-with-netlify/) about generating a static bundle of my Laravel site in order to host it statically on Netlify. This made take a closer look to the whole **JAMstack** shananigans.

I finally had some time left-over to give it an honest try. I was looking for something that utlizes Vue.js (ðŸ’š) since that's my go-to javascript framework and started goofing around with two options; [Nuxtjs](https://nuxtjs.org/) and [Gridsome.](https://gridsome.org/)

After some evaluation I landed in **Gridsome**, it just felt "more me".

## So, what is Gridsome?

Gridsome is a free and open source Vue.js-powered framework for building blazing fast static websites. The use of a centralized data layer in GraphQL makes it super easy to query/filter data from whatever source you prefer â€“ it can be an API, headless CMS or just plain markdown files. Gridsome is heavily inspired by Gatsby for React.

## Placeholder

In all honesty, my previous site had literally one post and one sub page. Nothing fancy whatsoever. 

However â€“ taking into account I hadn't been using Gridsome **_at all_** past this point it only took me about an hour to create a site with the same content I used on my previous site, with some improvements.

That's pretty fast I think.

Before I knew it, I had a site up and running with the following features;

- Markdown with frontmatter for content
- Filterable taxonomies
- Paginated content
- Progressive image lazy loading that resizes and crops images on the fly
- Tailwindcss setup in combination with Purgecss

> ðŸ¤© Not to mention, at this point the site was already ready to be deployed on Netlify with an SSL certificate.

Most of the features mentioned above comes out-of-the-box with Gridsome, however they have a really good [plugin ecosystem](https://gridsome.org/plugins/) which makes it easy to implement any additional features you might need.

For example, in order to be able to use markdown for my content I had to make use of said plugin ecosystem. You can read more about how to get started using markdown [here.](https://gridsome.org/plugins/@gridsome/transformer-remark)

Another thing that is required to manually set up on your own is your css framework of choice (if any). For me, as always it's Tailwindcss. 

Adding Tailwindcss is basically just a one-liner and you're done. In case you want to use Purgecss you'd have to go a little further than that, still very easy to setup. In fact, there's a section about it [in the documentation.](https://gridsome.org/docs/assets-css/#tailwind)

However, if you don't want to setup Tailwindcss + Purgecss on your own, there's a [plugin](https://gridsome.org/plugins/gridsome-plugin-tailwindcss) that will do it for you. ðŸ˜…

## Conclusion

Text..

So, if you're looking to get started on a JAMstack project using Vue.js and haven't tried Gridsome yet, you really â€“ **like really really** should try it out now!
