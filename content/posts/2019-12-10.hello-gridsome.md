Earlier this year [I wrote a post](/using-laravel-with-netlify/) about generating a static bundle of my Laravel site to host it on Netlify. It was great and all but during the year of 2019 I have been taking a closer look to the whole **JAMstack** shananigans.

I finally had some time left-over to give it an honest try. I was looking for something that utlizes Vue.js (ðŸ’š) since that's my javascript framework of choice and started goofing around with two options; [Nuxtjs](https://nuxtjs.org/) and [Gridsome.](https://gridsome.org/)

After some evaluation I landed in **Gridsome**, it just felt "more me".

> Gridsome is a free and open source Vue.js-powered framework for building websites & apps. Incredibly easy setup yet extremely powerful. 

It has a lot of cool features such as;

- Static file generation
- Automatic Code Splitting

- Setting up [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) was basically just a line of code.
- Even implementing something like [purgecss](https://github.com/FullHuman/purgecss) doesn't require much knowledge or skill following [the documentation.](https://gridsome.org/docs/assets-css/#tailwind)

I started poking around in the documentation and before I knew it I had a site very similar to my existing site, packed with amazing features ready to be deployed on Netlify.

â€“ Whoah! That was fast.



I was kinda sceptical at first since this project isn't very old...
