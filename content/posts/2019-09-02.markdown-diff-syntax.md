Imagine you're discussing code with someone over at GitHub and you'd like to propose a change in a code block someone wrote.

Or maybe you want to display a git diff in your release notes, or in an upgrade-guide of a package you're maintaining.

This can be easily achieved using markdown;

~~~markdown
 ```diff
 - published: false
 + published: true
 ```
~~~

The above markdown will then be rendered like this;

```diff
- published: false
+ published: true
```

Neat, huh? ðŸŽ‰
