Imagine you're discussing code with someone over at GitHub and you'd like to propose a change in a code block someone wrote. This can be easily achieved directly as a comment using markdown: 

~~~markdown
 ```diff
 - published: false
 + published: true
 ```
~~~

The above markdown will then be displayed like this;

```diff
- published: false
+ published: true
```

Pretty neat I think, happy code reviewing! ðŸŽ‰
