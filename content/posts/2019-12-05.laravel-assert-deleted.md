In a recent [pull request](https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/30648) authored by [@jasonmccreary](https://github.com/jasonmccreary) a new helper method for database testing was proposed to the Laravel framework.

This pull request quickly got merged and is now available in [Laravel ^6.6.0.](https://github.com/laravel/framework/releases/tag/v6.6.0)

It works the same way as the existing `assertSoftDeleted` method, meaning you may pass it a _model_ to assert the record was deleted.

> An `assertDeleted` method is symmetrical with this existing method and improves the developer experience by wrapping all the same behavior of `assertDatabaseMissing` in an intently named method.

Prior to **6.6.0** it would look something like this;

```php
$this->assertDatabaseMissing('posts', [
    'id' => $post->id,
    'title' => $post->title,
]);
```

After the changes in **6.6.0** we can now do this instead;

```php
$this->assertDeleted($post);
```
