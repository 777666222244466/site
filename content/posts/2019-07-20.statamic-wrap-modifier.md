Lately, I have been using Statamic's `wrap` modifier more and more. A very simple yet powerful modifier to help clean up my templates a little bit.

Simply put, it wraps a string with a given HTML tag, it also has the nice benefit of returning `null` if there is no data – making standard if statements rather reduntant.

Consider we have the following yaml;

```yaml
title: Hello, World
```

Usually when we conditionally display something, it would look something like this;

```html
{{ if title }}
  <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
{{ /if }}
```

Sure, one if statement like this isn't the end of the world, but what if the project grows bigger and you end up having like **5-10** if statements in your template? Rather messy.

Fortunately, we can clean this up simply by using the built-in `wrap` modifier in Statamic;

```html
{{ title | wrap:h1 }}
```

Want to add classes to your element? Sure, no problem – You may add Emmet-style CSS classes to the tag;

```html
{{ title | wrap:h1.fast.furious }}
```

Above example will give you the following output:

```html
<h1 class="fast furious">Hello, World</h1>
```

Simple yet powerful.
