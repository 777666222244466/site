      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>I'm a web developer from Sweden who enjoys developing great web applications, explore new technologies, contribute to open source projects and to spend time with my family. 👪</p>

      <p>Occasionally I will post neat little tips and tricks related to web development, mostly as a way to keep notes for my future self. Hopefully these notes can be of value to other fellow devs as well.</p>
